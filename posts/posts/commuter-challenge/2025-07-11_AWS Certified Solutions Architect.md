## 2025 Commuter Challenge is a Wrap

We wrapped up the 2025 Commuter Challenge a couple weeks ago. We saw **116 commuters** log at least one trip, **1,188 commuter days** recorded, **2301 total trips recorded**, and **7673.1 total miles** logged! I also had a great time creating [coasters and keychains](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLYisEPOEtN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MW1xNG9kdzl5aDI2cw==) as prizes.

### CSA Exam

All the while, I studied daily for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect test. I used a combination of [Adrian Cantrill's courses](https://learn.cantrill.io) and practice tests on [Tutorials Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com). These were invaluable for passing the test. Adrian's content and demo lessons are fantastic and the example tests on TD offered crucial practice with exam-style questions.

On Friday July 11, I took the test and am excited to announce that I passed! This has been in the works for a long time. I started studying the solutions architect course last year a few times a month and then ramped up the speed this year.

### Just Getting Started

This is just one more step. I'm still going to continue working on deploying the Commuter Challenge in AWS with CloudFormation templates. I'm tossing around some ideas for a wep app built with the API Gateway and Dynamo DB as well.

After a break from studying, I'm also going for the AWS Certified Developer certification. As we continue to step forward into a hybrid cloud/on-premises architecture at Brinks/PAI, this knowledge should be useful and I look forward to helping our organization take these steps.
