## Work Experience

### PAI, A Brink's Company

November 2020 to Present \
Billings, MT

#### Senior Product Engineer

January 2023 to Present

- Manage a feature team that delivers new features and products, maintains legacy code, performs DevOps, and improves the developer tooling for a network of over 100,000 ATMs nationwide.
- Proposed and led an effort to improve the front-end developer experience by transitioning our monolithic architecture to a Vite based monorepo. This results in instant feedback instead of 60-second cycles, improved linting, easier testing, and an upgrade path for legacy user interfaces.
- Led a project that integrated our system with a new wireless provider that reduced monthly data usage costs by approximately 30,000 per month. Developed tools that save the wireless team hours of time each week and created dashboards that provide insights for better decision making.
- Created an Incident Retrospective process for the development team to reflect on high severity incidents. This leads to actionable plans to prevent future incidents and better responses to incidents.

#### Software Engineer, L2

November 2020 to December 2023

- Coordinated three departments and a vendor to create a wireless device inventory management system that streamlines the entire process from the device being manufactured in China to deployment in the field. This saves the wireless, operations, and accounting teams hundreds of hours monthly.
- Built a process to resolve ATM disputes that saves months of person-hours of work each year, and tens of thousands of dollars in technician dispatches and unresolved disputes each month.
- Created a flexible ETL library that standardized our process for file based data feeds. This significantly reduced development time for new feeds, simplified monitoring and deployment.
