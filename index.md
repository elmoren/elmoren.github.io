# Welcome!

 My name is Nate Elmore and I'm a full stack software engineer with over ten years of experience in the industry. I'm currently a Senior Product Engineer for [PAI, A Brink's Company](https://www.gopai.com/). I lead a feature team developing products for both internal and external customers. I am fueled by my passion for solving problems and continually learning and improving my craft. You can take a look my [CV](/resume/) for a more details on my professional accomplishments.

 In my spare time, you can find me hiking and camping with my wife and dog, [bicycling](/commuter-challenge/), or [leatherworking](/leatherworking/). If you want to see some of the leatherworking process you can follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/birddogleather) or on [Etsy](https://birddogleather.com).

 Thanks for visiting! Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:nate@njelmore.com">nate@njelmore.com</a> if you want to chat or have any questions.
