# Leatherworking

I started leatherworking about around 2017 because I wanted a collar and leash for my dog, Murphy. So I did some reading, youtube tutorials, ordered some leather and basic tools. The first leash and collar I made were nothing to write home about, but I was hooked. Since then, I've make fly fishing wallets, wallets, totes, purses, and many other things. I accumulated piles of leather goods that I couldn't use myself if I tried. So I started a etsy store, [Bird Dog Leather](http://birddogleather.com), named after my initial inspiration for starting the hobby. If you want to know more, you can [follow my shop on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/birddogleather).  

The things I love most about leatherwork are making things I use everyday, the process of constantly striving to improve, and the community of other leather crafters always willing to help out.
